This directory includes the files of the manual assessment results in RQ1.

We manually assess whether the test inputs we generated are valid.

```CAT.txt```: the labeled test inputs for CAT.

```TransRepair.txt```: the labeled test inputs for TransRepair.

In these files, each test is decomposed into 4 lines.

Line 1: the input original sentence

Line 2: the mutant

Line 3: the word replacement

Line 4: the results of whether the test input is valid. (True for valid, False for invalid)
